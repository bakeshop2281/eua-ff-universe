# Alternate Universe: Eua/Rufus

## Universe Divergence Point

**Critical Difference:** At Junon gala, Vincent does NOT respond to Rufus's "future wife" comment. Eua develops feelings for Vincent throughout crisis but he maintains emotional distance despite mutual attraction.

**Post-Crisis Heartbreak:** After cult defeat, Eua confesses feelings to Vincent. He rejects her, citing Lucrecia guilt/ghosts, claiming he couldn't make her happy (doesn't admit his own attraction). Eua is devastated, heartbroken, directionless.

## Eua/Rufus Relationship Development

### The Kalm Cabin Encounter
**Setting:** Eua retreats to mother's cabin to regroup, finds Rufus and Turks waiting

**Eua's State:** Emotionally raw from Vincent's rejection, vulnerable but trying to maintain dignity, still in combat outfit, exhausted

**The Proposal Conversation:**
- Eua, on vulnerable whim, entertains marriage idea for practical reasons
- **Eua's Motivation:** Financial security to support aging mother
- **Rufus's Motivation:** 
  - Wife who can't be kidnapped, bribed, manipulated by enemies
  - Access to her memory-reading ability from gala
  - Her antipathy to corporate world prevents power struggles/betrayal
  - No political ambitions = no assassination threat

### The Corporate Marriage

**Wedding Arrangements:**
- Extensive pre-nuptial negotiations revealing character priorities
- Corporate-style wedding designed for photo opportunities  
- Legal/business transaction approach rather than romantic

**Boundary Setting:**
- Rufus proposes sexual relationship based on mutual attraction
- **Eua's Firm Stance:** "I'm traditional - I only sleep with someone I love"
- **Monogamy Requirement:** "You don't have to like it, but those are my terms"
- Rufus initially balks, continues seduction attempts (gets close but unsuccessful)

### Evolution to Romance

**The Monogamy Trial:**
- One suggests "trialing" monogamous relationship
- Gradual emotional development through this experiment
- Rufus discovers unexpected satisfaction in exclusive connection

**Foundation of Growing Attraction:**
- **Candid Communication:** Refreshing honesty unlike Rufus's other interactions
- **Eua Sees the Man:** Views Rufus as person, not threat/asset/rival
- **Mutual Acceptance:** Rufus has seen her worst (Jenova berserk), looks unflinchingly
- **Practical Partnership:** Both understand they're "using" each other but honestly
