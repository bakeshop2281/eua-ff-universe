## Extraction Template (For Reference)

*Use this template when asking AI to extract rich details from writing sessions:*

**"Before we hit context limits, please create Rich Detail Format documentation for the key scenes we just wrote. Include:**

**Scene Documentation:**
- Setting & emotional context
- Character states and development beats  
- Key dialogue exchanges with actual lines
- Important relationship dynamics

**Voice Library Updates:**
- Notable dialogue examples that show character voice well
- Any new speech patterns or verbal mannerisms discovered
- Lines that demonstrate relationship-specific communication
- Examples of emotional range (teasing, vulnerable, firm, etc.)

**Character Insights:**
- New personality traits or relationship dynamics established
- How characters are evolving or adapting
- Any dialogue that reveals character growth

**Format as detailed reference material I can add to my GitHub repo. Focus on what was actually significant in our session rather than fitting into predetermined categories."**
